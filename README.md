# python-fileparser

File parser is a python program that :

* Reads a file and counts the number of words that are in the file 

* Writes a list of all words in a file and the number of times they appear. 

* The default output file will be called “.words”. The program will take an input file via the command line. 

* A different output file can be used by using ‘-o’ option. For example “python3 file_parser.py doc.txt -o mywords.txt”.

- An example of the output file is below:
apple 4
dog 6
is 10
water 1
zebra 2 	

- Requirements:
Code must be PEP8 compliant
All variables should be descriptive
Must have good use of classes or functions
